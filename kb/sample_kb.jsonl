{"id": 1, "question": "Solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.", "solution_text": "Step 1: Write equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.\nStep 2: Try factorization: find numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5: -2 and -3.\nStep 3: Factor: (x-2)(x-3)=0.\nStep 4: Set each factor to 0: x-2=0 => x=2; x-3=0 => x=3.\nAnswer: x = 2 or x = 3."}
{"id": 2, "question": "Compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x^2 dx.", "solution_text": "Step 1: Recognize integral: âˆ«_0^1 x^2 dx.\nStep 2: Antiderivative of x^2 is x^3/3.\nStep 3: Evaluate from 0 to 1: (1^3)/3 - (0^3)/3 = 1/3 - 0 = 1/3.\nAnswer: 1/3."}
{"id": 3, "question": "A triangle has base 10 units and height 5 units. Find its area.", "solution_text": "Step 1: Formula for triangle area = (1/2) * base * height.\nStep 2: Substitute: (1/2) * 10 * 5.\nStep 3: Compute: 10 * 5 = 50; half of 50 is 25.\nAnswer: 25 square units."}
